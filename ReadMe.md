## GalaxyService - A stateful Service Fabric application scenario

A fictive stateful service that exposes information about the stars in many galaxies.

* Galaxy names are G-#
* Galaxies have stars and their names are S-#
* Each star has around 20 properties as key-value pairs
  * Try to find names that makes sense, otherwise call them P-# and V-#

* Thousands of researchers are hitting this service with Galaxy-Name & Star-Name combinations to get the data of the star they're looking for.
